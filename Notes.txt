1. Parent Container (.container .cards)

display: flex; - Turns the cards container into a flexbox, allowing cards to sit side-by-side
align-items: stretch; - Makes all cards stretch to match the height of the tallest card (ensures equal height)
gap: 20px; - Creates consistent spacing between cards

2. Individual Cards (.container .card)

flex: 1; - Makes each card take equal width (distributes available space equally among all cards)
display: flex; - Turns each card into a flex container for its internal content
flex-direction: column; - Stacks content vertically inside each card (icon → heading → paragraph → image)

3. Card Heading (.container .card h3)

min-height: 3em; - Ensures all headings occupy the same vertical space, even if text length differs

em vs rem:

em = relative to the parent element's font size
rem = relative to the root (html) element's font size
Using em here means "3 times the current font size of the heading"





4. Card Paragraph (.container .card p)

flex-grow: 1; - Allows paragraph to expand and fill available space, pushing the image down
margin-bottom: 20px; - Creates spacing between paragraph and image

5. Card Image (.container .card img)

margin-top: auto; - Pushes image to the bottom of the card (works with flexbox)
This ensures images align horizontally across all cards

6. Icon (.container .card icon)

height: 40px; width: 40px; - Fixed size ensures all icons are identical dimensions
display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; - Centers the icon content perfectly within the circle

Result: All cards have equal width and height, with icons, headings, and images aligned horizontally across cards, regardless of text content differences.

### Breaking Down Each Part:
flex: 0 0 calc(50% -10px);
**1. `flex-grow: 0`** (First number)
- Controls whether the item can **grow** to fill extra space
- `0` = "Don't grow beyond your set size"
- `1` = "Grow to fill available space"

**2. `flex-shrink: 0`** (Second number)
- Controls whether the item can **shrink** if there's not enough space
- `0` = "Don't shrink below your set size"
- `1` = "Shrink if needed"

**3. `flex-basis: calc(50% - 10px)`** (Third value)
- Sets the **initial/ideal size** of the item
- `calc(50% - 10px)` = "Take 50% of container width, minus 10px"

### Why `calc(50% - 10px)`?

Your `.container .cards` has `gap: 20px` which creates spacing between cards.

- Container width = 100%
- You want 2 cards side-by-side
- Gap between them = 20px

**The math:**
```
Card 1 width + Gap + Card 2 width = 100%
50% + 20px + 50% = 100% + 20px (TOO WIDE!)
```

**The solution:**
```
Each card = calc(50% - 10px)
Card 1: calc(50% - 10px) + Gap: 20px + Card 2: calc(50% - 10px) = 100%
